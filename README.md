## ProManage

A professional, offline-capable project management desktop application built with Python and Tkinter. ProManage transforms a modern UI prototype into a fully functional tool for managing projects, tasks, team members, and documents without external dependencies.

## Features

Complete Project Management: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Projects, Tasks, Team Members, and Documents.

Local Data Persistence: All data is automatically saved to a structured JSON storage system, ensuring it survives application restarts and is easily portable.

Professional Dashboard: Real-time overview with project statistics, task status breakdowns, and a live activity feed.

Dynamic Interaction: Instant search and filtering, right-click context menus for quick actions, and double-click editing.

Theme Support: Choose between Light and Dark themes. Your preference is saved across sessions.

Self-Contained: Requires only Python and its standard library—no complex databases or external services to install.

## Installation & Quick Start

1. Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.
2. Get the Code: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Run the Application: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute:
   ```bash
   python modern_ui.py
   ```
4. Data Storage: Upon first run, a `data/` directory will be created automatically to store all your information.

For detailed instructions, please see the `QUICK_START.md` and `USER_GUIDE.md` files included in the repository.

 ## Technical Overview

Language: Python 3.7+

GUI Framework: Tkinter (Standard Library)

## Data Storage: JSON files

Architecture: Modular design with clear separation between the user interface (`modern_ui.py`), data management layer (`data_manager.py`), and dialog controllers (`dialogs.py`).

## Project Status

This project represents a successful transformation from a static UI mockup into Version 1.0.0, a fully operational desktop application. All core objectives have been met, resulting in a polished, intuitive tool that is ready for use.

Key accomplishments include implementing a robust local storage engine, seamless integration of backend logic with the existing professional interface, addition of advanced user features like search, context menus, and theme persistence, and comprehensive user and technical documentation.
